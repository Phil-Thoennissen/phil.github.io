### Background

💡**We use SharePointOnline to store customer informations (pre-sales, offerings, project-related documents)** \
💡**Every customer folder contains those directories: 01_PRESALES / 02_ANGEBOT / 03_PROJEKTE** \
💡**Service Management related runbooks, backlog, IaC, pipelines are stored in GitHub, like cloudeteer/squad-\<customer abbreviation\>**

❗**WE DO NOT STORE CUSTOMER DOCUMENTS IN GITHUB**❗

**Links you should know:**
