### WHY we build it?

- Commercial products way too expensive (Splunk,New Relic,Datadog,AppDynamics ..)
- Commercial products always lacking timely integration of hyperscaler changes
- Majority of commercial products is using the usual Open Source components under-the-hood
- 🌥️ Using observability tools which are well-known since years & strong community footprint
- 🌥️ Having a consistent & quick way to setup **Cloud Base Observability Foundation**, cloud-agnostic
- 🌥️ Build targeted Grafana Dashboards for different stakeholders (Operations, Business ..)
- 🌥️ **CLEAR COMPETETIVE DIFFERENTIATOR FOR OUR MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES!**
- 🌥️ **OPS_STACK DEFAULT INSTALLATION IS FOR FREE FOR ANY MANAGED SERVICES CUSTOMER!**

### WHAT is it?

> Well-chosen Open Source components for professional, multi-cloud observability. \
> Running complitly at customer cloud environment for full transparency & no data privacy issues. \
> Including Dashboards for operations, as well relevant alerting channels (webhook, email).

### HOW do we deploy it?

- AKS foundation with our terragrunt based deployment-framework
- Using private Container registry
