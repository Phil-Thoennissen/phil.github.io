### WHY we build it?

- No commercial product available to combine multi-cloud business insights
- No commercial reporting solution out-of-the-box providing views (PowerBI, Tableau..)
- Commercial products only targeting one specific concern, like costs or inventory overview
- üå•Ô∏è Having a modern web-based, responsive & widget-based dashboard
- üå•Ô∏è Not building an operational dashboard (way to complicated & always lacking features)
- üå•Ô∏è Fully focus on representation, what almost any our customers looking for
- üå•Ô∏è Easy abstraction layer of important infos, like cloud costs, top costcenter, critical advisories ..
- üå•Ô∏è Integrating basic user-interaction for simple tasks, like disconnect AVD-Sessions
- üå•Ô∏è **CLEAR COMPETETIVE DIFFERENTIATOR FOR OUR MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES!**
- üå•Ô∏è **DEEP_VIEW DEFAULT INSTALLATION IS FOR FREE FOR ANY MANAGED SERVICES CUSTOMER!**

### WHAT is it?

- Laravel PHP framwork
- VUE.js, Tailwind CSS
- Working on any web server with php
- Redis cache for very quick data presentation
- Lot's of custom-integrated logic (mostly from Impfzentren demands)
- Integrated external systems, like ITSM Ticketing overview
- Very targeted Views, like for AVD, VPN-Connections, Application Insights, Advisories ..
- Integration of some basic user interaction, like disable AAD-User, change User Passwords or terminate AVD Sessions
- _in-progress: persistence data layer (currently we do not store any data), better ACL controls_

### HOW do we deploy it?

- Currently based on a single IaaS/VM
- Kubernetes HELM chart is in progress and tested (so we can easily deploy it in our OPS.STACK AKS)
- Azure-AD SSO as default for User-Login (based on Application-Registration & AAD-Group assignment)
