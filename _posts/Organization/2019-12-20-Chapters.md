**Here are all Links for Chapters**

Chapters are an organizational unit in which Cloudeteers with different roles, but similar interests in technologies or services are assembled. The idea is to use chapters as incubators for focused innovation, training, and delivery quality standardization.

The chapter lead is responsible to accomplish the goals set for a chapter by CLOUDETEER leadership, guides chapter members in their technical development, and develops strategic vendor relationships.

Everyone is assigned to at least one Chapter. This is then called primary Chapter. Besides that everyone can be part of one or more additional Chapters. This is then called secondary Chapter assignment.
