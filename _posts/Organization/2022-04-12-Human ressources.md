### Values and our together

##### Communication

###### Meetingculture

**General rules for a happy cooperation**

At Cloudeteer, we've developed a few general rules that should basically be fine for everyone here.
Those rules should save you time, create more gaps to take small breaks and ensure easy information transfer.

**UNNECESSARY MEETINGS**

**Try to avoid them!** <br>
Ask yourself: is it just about sharing information? Then a group-mail or a group chat would be enough!

Some Advantages of group mails:
* Everyone can process the information at their own pace
* Time-consuming appointment searches are not necessary
* If you only participate, but have nothing to do with the meeting, then do not participate.
* If you are present in the meeting as a listener, **note this at the beginning** - this helps to avoid uncertainty among colleagues.

**RESPECT BREAKS**<br>
Avoid searching for Meetings between 12:00 and 13:00 (most common break for a lot of us)

**CUT SOME SLACK**<br>
Do you see that your colleague will have no breaks before and after the scheduled meeting? – cut him/her some slack (e.g. leave 5 minutes before and after) She/He will thank you later ;-)

**AGENDAS MATTER**<br>
While intiving to an meeting please set an Agenda.
Minimum = Set the goal of the meeting and the most important points to discuss

**NEAR TERM ANSWERS**<br>
Timely commitment or cancellation with justification (helps your colleagues to understand)

**TIMELINESS**<br>
Get to the meeting on time.
Your colleages take their time to speak to you.
We respect each others spent time.

**PREPAREDNESS**<br>
Be prepared for the meeting ahead.

**SHARED RESPONSIBILITY**<br>
While beeing with customers - take over the task of creating minutes of the meeting if your other colleague is moderating.

**PARTICIPATE**<br>
Imagine being in a meeting where just two people are participating and the rest is silent.
This is probably not comfortable for those who actively participating. It could make them feel insecure which in turn can lower their motivation in the future.

**RESPECT**<br>
Make your colleagues feel that they and their concerns are important. Chatting or doing other distractiing thinkgs during a meeting is not okay!

**A MEANINGFUL END**<br>
At the end of the meeting, determine the resulting actions (e.g.determine a new appointment, distribute tasks).
Ask yourselves at the end – „What is the result?“

**SHOW YOURSELF**<br>
A turned on camera creates more personality, commitment and security. You see what the other person is doing and whether they are actively listening to you.

**IT‘S ABOUT TIME**<br>
The duration of a meeting should not exceed the 1,5 hours mark. We lose our concentration over time. Short concise appointments are **more effective** and therefore also more **motivating** , because they do not take up so much time. Note that the 1.5 hours is an absolute **maximum!**

### Organizational processes

##### Vacation

The Cloudeteer Guidelines require that the entry of your vacation is always coordinated with both your squadleads, as well as your chapterleads and your tribelead. In purely communicative terms, the information transfer could look like this:

> Hello dear colleagues,
>
> I would like to take a vacation from xxx to xxx.
> Can you check if this is possible for the current project situation? If confirmed, I would submit this leave.

This is an example of a short circular email to the above mentioned people.

The leave will be entered after confirmation in our tool ([Urlaubsplaner](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/47dcdf65-6c6e-47c8-bccc-cd2d1b9e75ee?tenantId=9c1de352-64a4-4509-b3fc-4ef2df8db9b8&source=portal&screenColor=rgba(0%2C%20176%2C%20240%2C%201))), or via teams (**screenshot**) and final confirmed again by your TL. You will receive a final feedback via the tool.

To help you with the preparations before starting ypur vacation we have made a short checklist:
- Inform and get approval from leads (Squad lead, Chapter Lead, Tribe leads)
- Enter your vacation in the vacation tool
- Block your vacation in your personal calender so that everyone is informed about your absence
- Turn on your Out-Of-Office agent (automatic response); please pay attention to the wording as non-cloudeteers (customers) will receive this response. Avoid mentioning customer names.
- MANDATORY: Do a handover to colleagues. Depending on the subject it may be suffient if the handover is done via email but could also be necessary to do this in a personal meeting.

Vacation cancellations should be communicated briefly to above mentioned persons. Cancellation cannot be done on your own. For that you have to contact either Leonie ([ls@cloudeteer.de](mailto:ls@cloudeteer.de)) or Thomas ([td@cloudeteer.de](mailto:td@cloudeteer.de)).
In case of technical problems concerning the vacation booking tool you can contact either Leonie ([ls@cloudeteer.de](mailto:ls@cloudeteer.de)) or Thomas ([td@cloudeteer.de](mailto:td@cloudeteer.de)) as well.

**Small tip:**

> We try to roughly plan about 20 days of our vacation already in Q1 of the year. This prevents unnecessary accumulation of vacation days and better coordination among colleagues. Also, this is important in case you are interested in working from abroad as well. Read more here ([Working abroad](#working-abroad))

##### Illness

Everyone gets sick or feels bad once in a while. This is not a problem. If one day you don't feel well/healthy, please inform your SL, CL and your TL about it. If it is possible for you, try to reschedule the dates of the period for which you will be absent, or communicate your absence to the stakeholders.  If this type of coordination is no longer possible due to health reasons, inform your TL about the lack of communication so that he/she can do it for you.
No certificate from your doctor is required for sick leave for up to 2 days. For 3 days or more, or if you report sick after 2 days, we need a certificate from your doctor. You should first submit this as a photocopy to Oliver ([om@cloudeteer.de](mailto:om@cloudeteer.de)) and then hand it over to us as an original.

You can send it by mail to the following address:

> *Cloudeteer GmbH <br>
> c/o Datagroup <br>
> z. Hd. Oliver Möhl <br>
> Brandshofer Deich 68 <br>
> 20539 Hamburg*<br>

##### Time booking

Each of us books his work hours for both internal and external work. Currently we use the tool [Zoho](https://books.cloudeteer.de/).

> IMPORTANT: Please complete your time tracking  every week and finish tracking activities as early as possible before the end of every month!

How exactly to book the respective times for different projects can be found in the respective customer engagements. If you have any questions, please contact the respective SL.
<br>
<br>

##### Travel expenses

When travelling for Cloudeteer it may happen that you have to pay something in advance (e.g. cab fares, tickets for public transport, etc.). If this the case youl will of course get the money back from Cloudeteer. To get your money back everyone has to fill out the according forms in [ZOHO Expense](https://expense.zoho.com/home). This is necessary beacause of legal requierements. The following steps are one way to use the forms in ZOHO:

<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_1.jpg" width="75%"><br>
Start ZOHO Expense with the link above<br>
Click on "Aufwendungen"<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_2.jpg" width="75%"><br>
Click on "+Neue Aufwendungen"<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_3.jpg" width="75%"><br>
Fill the red marked fields accordingly<br>
Don't forget to add a "Beleg" for prooving the expense<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_4.jpg"><br>
<br>
Last field of the form gives you the psossibility to add you current "Beleg" to a "Bericht"<br>
You can associate an existing one or create a new one<br>
If you choose to create a new one the following form comes up:<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_5a.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Here you have to enter all red marked fields starting with the name for the new "Bericht". For example "Reisekosten 05/2022"<br>
Then you need to add a report period. In case you do your reporting monthly it would be advised to have the report started from the 1st day of the month to the last<br>
Then you could optional add a customer and finally your name<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_6.jpg" width="75%"><br>
After filling out the first expense form, close and save it with "Speichern und schließen"<br>
The open the "Berichte" section by clicking on "Berichte"<br>
Here select the report which you added to your expense in the last step (in our case "Reisekosten 05/22")<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/HR_Expense_7.jpg" width="75%"><br>
The last step ist to submit the report to the assigned approver by clicking "Übermitteln"<br>
<br>
An informational e-email is sent to the approver and to you. After approval another mail is sent to you. The money will then be paid from Cloudeteer normally within a week.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Working abroad

CLOUDETEER wants to enable you to work part of your time from abroad. For this purpose, we have developed rules.
If you are interested in working abroad, contact Leonie (HR) at least 4-5 weeks in advance so that there is enough time for planning. Both your tribelead and management and your squadlead and chapterlead must be informed of your desire. All must agree.
Currently, the process is still very individual. We would like to make it possible for you to work abroad, but it is not always possible.

Following rules are important:

* One month per year / per employee
  * May be broken down into individual weeks (not days)
* Must have 20 days of vacation already planned for the year
* You must be available during German working hours
* Internet access, health insurance and workplace design is not our task and must be organized by employee
* In the probationary period (first 6 months) not possible
* In case of problems a call back (within 3 days) is possible
  * Previous problems will be considered for upcoming trips for the year.

The following documents are required for working abroad:

* Work Abroad agreement signed by you and the management.
* Checklist for working abroad filled out and completely filed by you

Both documents will be given to you by HR once the process gets to that point.
